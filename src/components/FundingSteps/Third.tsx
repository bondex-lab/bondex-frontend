                    This implementation was built for the Hackathon as an example use case.

                <Paragraph>
                    While the mechanism can work for salaries and business financing in general, our demo version uses on-chain verification of stable cash flows sourced from a community pool.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    These flows are activated through the creation of a <b>Continuous Fund</b> in the <b>Protocol Pool</b> module, where the <b>Community Pool</b>â€™s <b>Spend</b> has been allocated.
                </Paragraph>
            </div>

                <Paragraph>
                    Now you need to send using <b>CLI</b> a proposal so that the funds can start flowing into the escrow account.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    Once the <b>Continuous Fund</b> is created, you will be able to work with your assets.
                </Paragraph>
