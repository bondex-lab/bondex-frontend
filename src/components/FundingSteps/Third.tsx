                our demo version uses on-chain verification of stable cash flows sourced from a community pool.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                These flows are activated through the creation of a <b>Continuous Fund</b> in the <b>Protocol Pool</b> module,
            </Text>
            <Text>
                where the <b>Community Pool</b>â€™s <b>Spend</b> has been allocated.
            </Text>
            <br/>
            <Text>
                Now you need to send using <b>CLI</b> a proposal so that the funds can start flowing into the escrow account.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Once the <b>Continuous Fund</b> is created, you will be able to work with your assets.
